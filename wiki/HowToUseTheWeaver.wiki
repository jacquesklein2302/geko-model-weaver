#summary This page explains the different ways of using GeKo - An extensible generic weaver for EMF based models.

= Introduction =

There are three different ways of using GeKo:

 # You can download an Eclipse installation that has everything you need in it (including source code and examples).
 # Or you download a jar containing all GeKo Eclipse plug-ins (including source code and plug-ins containing examples but excluding EMF dependencies).
 # The last and most lightweight solution is to download a jar containing only the plug-ins needed to use GeKo with your models (including source-code but excluding examples, extensions and dependencies).


= Simple Usage =

Once you downloaded GeKo in any of the different ways the way to use it is always the same:

 # Start an Eclipse instance that runs the GeKo plug-ins (either by dumping them in the plugins folder or by importing them as projects and running a new instance using a run / debug configuration).
 # Select the `*`.ecore file of the metamodel used by the models you want to weave and right-click on it. In the appearing "GeKo Weaver" submenu select the option "Generate Base, Pointcut and Advice Editors".
 # Go to the folder where the base model that you want to weave is located. Right-click on it and in the appearing "New" submenu select the option "Other..." (or press Ctrl+N instead). In the appearing wizard there is a category "Example EMF Model Creation Wizards". In it you should find a pointcut editor for your metamodel. Select it and click on "Next". Decide on a location and file name and click on "Next". _Choose "Pointcut" from the "Model Object" dropdown list_ and click on "Finish".
 # In the created pointcut model you can add arbitrary model elements by right-clicking on the root element "Pointcut" and choosing an entry from the "New Child" submenu.
 # You can design your advice model in a similar way using the generated Wizard.
 # Once you are ready for weaving select your base, pointcut and advice model, right-click on one of them and choose "Weave (Inferring Pointcut to Advice Mapping)" in the "GeKo Weaver" submenu.


= Custom Pointcut to Advice Mappings =

Whenever you design a pointcut and advice for which GeKo cannot guess which pointcut element corresponds to which advice element by looking at String attributes you have to help out a little bit:
 # Right-click once again on the folder containing your base model. In the appearing "New" submenu select once again the option "Other...". Create a new "Pc2AvMapping Model" using the generated wizard just as you did for the pointcut and advice model. _This time select "Mapping" as root "Model Object"._
 # Create mapping entries using the familiar "New Child" submenu and refer to elements of the pointcut and advice model in the property view.
 # Once you created mapping entries for all pointcut and advice elements that were not matched automatically by Geko you are ready for weaving: select your base, pointcut, advice and mapping model, right-click on one of them and choose "Weave (Inferring Completion of Pointcut to Advice Mapping)" in the "GeKo Weaver" submenu.


= Creating Own Extensions =

If you want to create extensions for GeKo because your metamodel cannot be handled in a completely generic way have a look at the source code and the [http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/geko-model-weaver/trunk/doc/0.1/index.html JavaDoc]. Although [https://www.ohloh.net/p/geko-model-weaver ohloh.net] believes that GeKo has "Extremely well-commented source code" you are welcome to get in contact with a developer in case someting remains unclear.
